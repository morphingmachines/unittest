# UnitTest

This project contains APIs for Verilator driver, useful for running system-verilog simulations.

This project uses [playground]() as a library. `playground` and `unittest` directories should be at the same level, as shown below.
```
  workspace
  |-- playground
  |-- unittest
```
Make sure that you have a working [playground](https://github.com/morphingmachines/playground.git) project before proceeding further. And donot rename/modify `playground` directory structure.

<!----

More targets can be listed by running `make`.
